# bond
Bond is a child-friendly journaling website that encourages kids aged 5 and up to express themselves through creativity, reflection, and fun printable activities. Inspired by the idea that children grow through love, imagination, and emotional connection, Bond offers a space where writing becomes magical.
Children can explore a variety of printable journals, coloring sheets, reward charts, and mood trackers — all designed to build confidence, independence, and mindfulness. Whether a child wants to start a gratitude journal, track habits, or express emotions through colors, Bond gives them the tools to do so in a playful, safe, and accessible way.
The project uses HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript, focusing on responsive design to ensure accessibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
